# Arduino-FT857-CAT
A display of some Yaesu FT-857D’s parameters was developed for a 4×20 LCD screen. 
The software implements via the serial link the FT-857D CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) controls and additional readings of the transceiver’s EEPROM. 
The developments were made from a source code developed for Arduino by VE3BUX.
